## Development

### Setting Up Your API Server

The mobile app needs to connect to your Laravel API. For local development, you need to expose your local server so the mobile device/simulator can access it.

#### Option 1: Using Laravel Herd (Recommended for macOS)

```bash
# Share your local site
herd share

# Update .env with the provided URL
API_URL=https://your-app.herd.sh
```

#### Option 2: Using ngrok

```bash
# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 80

# Update .env with the provided URL
API_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

#### Option 3: Using Artisan Serve

```bash
# Start the development server
php artisan serve

# For local network access, use your machine's IP
# Update .env with your local IP
API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000
```

### Running the Mobile App

```bash
# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
php artisan native:run ios

# Run on Android emulator/device
php artisan native:run android

# Watch for changes (hot reload)
php artisan native:watch ios
php artisan native:watch android
```
